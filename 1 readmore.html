<div class="div">Mr Gareth</div> was found dead on his bed at 12:55am on the 13th of July, 1995
Mr Gareth was a wealthy business man who owns Gareth's group of companies
He was murdered without any stabbings or bullet holes in his body
His wife, Thelma quickly reported her husband's murder to the police in that district
The police arrived there 20min later Along side some forensic scientists for proper investigation
"This was no natural death" they said..
He had been murdered
Inspector Logan the head police in that district called me immediately stating he has a job for me
I was asleep when he called
Without any long talks I had understood what he said... I had a case to solve.

I was a well known Detective in the state of Los Angeles popularly known as LA.
I have succeeded in solving numerous murder cases.. I was the best in town to
     *             *             *
I arrived at Logan's office the next day both me and my assistant
He drove us to the deceased house for further investigation and questioning

When we arrived, we met with Thelma Mr Gareth's wife, their Butler Alfred and their maid Susan

I introduced my self as Detective Hugh and my assistant Barry 
I told her I'll be the one in charge of your husband's murder case

I started by consoling  her about Mr Gareth's death
I asked her to give us her full cooperation.... Not only her but the servants also

I lighted my cigar and began questioning Thelma what had happened yesterday before the murder

She narrated;
"I had a conference meeting yesterday around 6am... My husband who also had a business deal that same day was asleep.. So I didn't disturb him as I went out to attend my Conference meeting

The meeting had finished around 7pm.. I had to visit the office to see if everything was in order... I spent 3hrs there

I went to my friends place who needed something important.. I spent roughly 2hrs there

I came back around 12:35am midnight... It was a hectic day so I didn't bother to check on him that quickly
I spent 20 min resting on the couch when I decided to go sleep inside
I entered the room and saw him asleep which is very odd
He always goes to sleep around 1am because of some business works..
I tried waking him but he didn't move an inch.... Then I decided to check his heartbeat and to my greatest surprise he was dead..
That's when I called the police "

I further asked her if her husband had any health complication
She replied;
"No.... But he was allergic to smoke or anything in gaseous form"

With the looks of it ... Thelma wasn't at home when the murder had took place 

I took a quick look in the room for any clues

But something caught my eye
It was a small white handkerchief which had a symbol on it, a white hand glove and a female anklet

I went ahead and asked Thelma if this was her husband handkerchief

She said her husband only use black handkerchief.
I didn't ask her about the remaining clues for some sort of reasons known by me 

I was surprised and happy at the same time
I have gotten some clues

I made sure she didn't tell anyone about this

So it was Alfred's turn to be questioned

I asked him exactly what I had asked Thelma

He narrated;
"I was busy cleaning my Master's room and ironing his cloth around 8am
My master had finished bathing and wore his cloth around 8:30am"

I further asked Alfred how he managed to know the exact time all these had taken place

He further said;
"I'm a Butler...  So its my duty to keep  to time... I'm always time conscious"

OK ... Then I asked him what had happened after that

He replied;
"My master sent me to the supermarket to get some foodstuffs for the house..
That was exactly around 8:55am.

I arrived in the afternoon about 2:03pm... The house was empty... Even Susan wasn't at home.. I took my spare keys and opened the door... I carried all the foodstuffs in
I tidy up the house .. Then I went to sleep around 3pm

I woke up at exactly 6:05pm... Expecting my Master to be back yet but there was no sign of him..
I waited for a while 
It was 11:45pm when I heard a knock on the door
It was my Master...

 He was coughing when he had entered the house ... I asked him if he wanted hot coffee
He said I shouldn't bother 
"It was a mild cough.... Its nothing Alfred.. Go rest"
He said to me
I didn't believe that...  But there was nothing I could do....  He was very strict. 
I went to my room pacing around then suddenly I fell asleep 

I was sleeping when I was awakened by sirens
It was 1:15am
20min later after Mr Gareth's had been murdered.."

I asked him if there were any traces of someone entering the house?

He replied
"No sir... I would have known if someone had entered the house

But I remembered something... When I was cleaning Mr Gareth's room
I forgot to lock the windows"

So the murderer must have came in through there I muttered 

I went into the room again and inspected the window for any clues
I didn't find any except for some dried blood stains

Maybe the murderer must have been injured when trying to escape I said to myself

So Susan was the next person to be questioned

But before that I spotted an injury on her knee
I asked her how and when she got that

She said;
"I was cooking food for Mr Gareth when I slipped and fell down in the kitchen
It was yesterday"

I further asked her the same thing I asked Thelma and Alfred

She replied;
"I prepared coffee for Mr Gareth before he had gone to work... He doesn't miss his early morning coffee for anything
I further asked him if I could go see my mum ... He said I could go but until when Alfred comes back... 
I waited for Alfred for a long time... I was uncomfortable waiting so I remembered each of us has a spare key... So I went out to see my mother and I just arrived today"

I asked her if perhaps she do use hand gloves 

She said;
"Yes sir....  Just only when I want to clean the kitchen"

OK Susan..  You may go now... I said 

Susan wasn't at home.... She can't be the one neither Alfred the butler 

So I decided to end it there... I'll be coming tomorrow to continue with the investigation I told Thelma.

We bade them good bye.... As we were moving out I saw Alfred with the same handkerchief and an hand glove in His Breast pocket but I didn't question him as It may have dropped when he was cleaning Mr Gareth's room..  I concluded 

I reached home thinking about the statement each of them had given
Until I remembered Susan saying "she was cooking food for Mr Gareth and further said she was making coffee"
But there was no food in the house ... Alfred went to get some
I also remembered her wounded knee and some pair of hand gloves 
She wasn't at home too

But who could have own the anklet I found in the crime scene 

Even the forensic scientists haven't given us any details of what had killed Mr Gareth

Could it be Susan who committed the murder???
</p>
 I was on my way home when I got a call from Logan.. Saying he needed to see me urgently

I asked myself... What could be so urgent
I turned my car around and drove to Logan's office

I arrived at his office and asked him why the sudden call?

One of the forensic scientists handling Mr Gareth's body came over some hours ago and dropped this... 
This could lead us to the actual killer... He said
Holding the file in his hands

This is great.... As I stretched my hand to collect file from Logan

After reading the file... I was amazed...
According to the file.. Two harmful chemical substances were found in Mr Gareth's body
Hydrogen sulphide and methanol

But something doesn't seem Right to me

It said here that;

"The Hydrogen sulphide was not suppose to kill him instantly rather it will take days... But the methanol present  in his body stimulated the hydrogen sulphide which then lead to Mr Gareth's death

The hydrogen sulphide was in gaseous form while methanol was in liquid form....

The methanol was found in  the handkerchief with a symbol on it"

Suddenly... I remembered Mr Gareth was allergic to smoke or anything in gaseous form

What a smart move... I said
The killer must have known Mr Gareth's weakness and used it against him....

But why was the methanol found in Alfred's handkerchief when Mr Gareth only use black handkerchief? I asked myself
 
But I was still confused.... 
How did methanol get into body...

Do you think it's food poisoning... Logan asked? 
I'm not sure Logan...
This is really a hard nut to crack.

The whole situation and case are complicated

Did you show this to anybody else?

No Hugh.. As soon as the forensic scientist came over to drop this.. I called you immediately
I haven't shown it to anyone else

Alright then...I'll be leaving now Logan.. I need to go home and study this file.. I need to get to the bottom of this

Alright Hugh... Wish you good luck.. Logan said

**********

I left Logan's office with the file and went home...

Getting home I thought about a lot of things

"How did the methanol get there
Who gave it to him
And why was it found in Alfred's handkerchief?"

So many questions I myself can't answer

Later that day I got a call from Thelma..
She said the personal assistant I wanted to see will be arriving tomorrow... 

Alright.. I'll be there .. I replied
I ended the call feeling some kind of relief.. 

I sat down on my couch studying the file and making some research and  thinking how Alfred came into the picture all of a sudden

My assistant Barry came in handy... He really knows a lot about science

I asked him to decode it for me
20 min later... He figured out something

He said;
"From what I've studied... Methanol cannot be used as a food poisoner.. But it can be used to kill someone.. Its very powerful
It has an odour similar to Methylated spirit .. It could cause blindness if it come in contact with the eye

There are some certain ways in which the chemical must have gotten into Mr Gareth's body

Since you found traces of it on Alfred's handkerchief... 

Perhaps he made Mr Gareth sniffed it or some other ways which Alfred had in mind"

Wow... Nice work Barry.. I commended him

I left Barry and went into my room

Could Alfred be lying all this while? I asked myself

I don't think I'm going to show this to Thelma..
Until I get to bottom of this and to be on the safer side.. I said

I slept off while thinking of the complicated situation

It was 7am already... Me and Barry are getting ready to leave..

We came out of The house and drove off to Mr Gareth's House

Getting there..
As usual we were welcomed by Alfred

I couldn't sight Thelma anywhere so I asked him where she was

She has gone out sir... For some work.. She will be back soon... He said

And the assistant? I asked

He will be here shortly.. He replied

OK Alfred.
But if you aren't busy I need to ask you some question
I sounded unsuspicious

Go on Sir.. You can ask

How close was Thelma and Mr Gareth? I asked

To be honest sir.... There weren't as close as that...
Since the time they were married
I used to be family Butler before Mr Gareth got married

Wow.... You've spent a long time here Alfred..

One more thing.... Does Thelma know anything about Mr Gareth... Like his likes and dislikes?

Absolutely not... They both don't know anything about each other..
 They just eat, go to work and sleep... Those were their normal routine at home.
It has been like that since they were married
Sometimes I wonder how they were married to each other

Thank you Alfred.. You may  go now...

Then I thought of something.. Since Thelma doesn't know a lot about Mr Gareth.. How could she know he use a black handkerchief

There is more to this... I said

"Someone knocks on the door"

I'll go get it.. Alfred said

It was the Mr Gareth's PA

Good morning Sir... My name is Jake foster Mr Gareth's PA
Sorry I'm late... I had to attend to some issues at work

You came at the right time Jake...

You may excuse us Alfred.. I said

I told Barry to take down some points for me while I asked Jake some questions

So Mr Jake.. Were you aware Mr Gareth had been murdered?

Yes sir... Thelma told me about it why I was away on a business trip..
She called me yesterday that you needed to see me for some questioning

You're right... Jake
So were you with Mr Gareth on the day of the murder?

You were suppose to be with him since he had a business deal on that day?
Can you explain what had happened?

He said;
"Yes Sir.. We had a business deal with a company who was suppose to deliver chemicals to us..
We went there to strike a deal with them

As we were about to go in... They gave both me and Mr Gareth gas masks to protect us from harmful chemicals

I wore mine but MR Gareth didn't.. He said he needed to use the restrooms first..

10min later there was a gas outbreak..
Luckily for me I was putting on my gas masks

We were told to evacuate the area ... I couldn't find Mr Gareth

So I went towards the restroom and saw Mr Gareththis heading towards me

He was using his handkerchief to cover his nose...
I directed him out and asked him if perhaps he inhaled the gas so we could go see a doctor

He said he didn't... His handkerchief was able to protect him from the gas... 

I was relieved.
 Some hours passed... The deal was sealed and we were heading home

On our way to his house... He was seriously coughing
I asked him if we could go see a doctor?

No Jake... Its fine.. I'll be OK tomorrow.. I need you to go to Chicago tomorrow.. Its very important.. He said

Alright sir.. I dropped him home then drove to my House
Thelma called me the next day stating he was murdered that night... I was surprised.
Though she didn't give me the exact details on how he was murdered..
I couldn't come over to the house cause I was already in Chicago then

That was what happened sir"

Wow... The whole case is getting clearer now
Mr Gareth was not murdered rather he died due to the chemical he inhaled

Hydrogen sulphide was present in Mr Gareth's body so due to that he died slowly

I thanked Jake for helping us with the statement he just made
I told him I was done.... So he was free to go

He thanked me and left..

I can't wait to tell Thelma about this..
She would be happy ... I said

While waiting for Thelma to come.. 
I went In search of Alfred.. I couldn't find him.

I checked all the rooms but there was no sight of him..
Finally I saw Alfred in Thelma's room packing his clothes and some money.
He was sweating profusely and was shocked to see me

He wanted to run away through the other door but Barry caught him before he could do that

We tied him to a chair and demanded answers from him

Where is Thelma and why were you trying to escape? I asked him

He refused to talk... So I pointed my gun at him

Out of fear... He started talk
He said;
During the day of the murder.... Thelma gave me a substance called methanol to put in Mr Gareth's handkerchief... 
I did as she instructed... In return she promised me a huge sum of money "

So that was how the methanol got into Mr Gareth's body

Things started to get clearer now

"During the gas outbreak... Mr Gareth didn't use his gas masks Rather his handkerchief
So that was how it got into his body"

I suspected you when there were traces in  your handkerchief...

So both you and Thelma murdered Mr Gareth...

Why did you do that? I asked

He was mute... Then I shot at the window and pointed it at him again

He then said;
"Thelma would always come to me every night to satisfy herself stating Mr Gareth didn't care about her or her needs
Her family forced her to marry Mr Gareth because of his wealth

She didn't want to.. But since Mr Gareth didn't care much about her... She planned to kill him.. Take his wealth and run away
Since then... She had been planning to kill... She just waited for the right time

She promised me a huge sum of money if I satisfy her every night and help her get rid of Gareth

Even the day of the murder She was in my room.... 
After we were done... She then said
He would have been dead by now... Let me go check..

Then later on she called the police... 
That was all Sir... I swear "

Wow... Well planned...
Thelma was pretending all these while

Where is she ? I asked

She is at the airport... She is on her way to France..

Oh my gosh!!!... I quickly called Logan to send some of his men to Mr Gareth's house
And the rest to the airport

Thelma is the real murderer.. I said to him

I told Barry to keep an eye on Alfred while I rush to  the airport

I drove as fast as I can... 
Getting to the airport... I asked if the plane heading to France has left?

Sorry sir... The plane took off 30min earlier

Gosh!!! As I hit my hands against the wall..

Suddenly I heard footsteps heading towards me

It was Logan and his men... Thelma was arrested too

I was glad and surprised
How were you able to catch her? I asked

He said;
"I have a friend who works as a pilot here.. As soon as you called me..
I called him too... Telling him to delay the flight for a little bit.. Luckily he was the one flying the plane to France

Some minutes later we for there.. We saw Thelma arguing with some employees
Then we arrested her.."

I was relieved and happy..
We head over to the police station

Alfred too was arrested and thrown  in jail.
I began questioning Thelma...

I asked her why she had done that?

She said;
"I just hate the sight of that man... I would have escaped if it wasn't for this moron Alfred"

I laughed... Then I told her
Did you know Mr Gareth had a son?

She was shocked and confused
How?
When?
She asked

Well.... Since you were busy creating your master plan

Your so called husband was busy raping Susan
He raped her and got her pregnant..
But he wasn't aware he had a son since Susan didn't mention it to him

F*uck you, f*uck Gareth, f*uck all of you.. She yelled

She was thrown into the cell

*********

2months later... She was sentenced to life imprisonment
While Alfred was sentenced to 15yrs imprisonment

Well... Both Thelma and Alfred were now imprisoned

Susan was given all the property... She, her child and her mum lived a happy life

I on the hand.... 
I'm on vacation..
 Need to clear my head for a while
Barry was now in charge... 
He was given a case before I left... I wished him good luck..

I guess this ends here...
I remain your humble detective HUGH ANTHONY
