    <h2>WHO DID IT?
    EPISODE 1</h2>
    
    On the 10th and 11th of June, 2010
    Three different cases of murder occurred in St Richard memorial high school
    
    2 students were murdered on both dates
    
    Samantha Gilbert was the first to be murdered on the 10th of June
    She is 19yrs old, blonde hair and an average height and in grade 11 .
    She was murdered with a knife, stabbed in her throat
    She was found dead by the janitor at 11:05pm
    
    Eric Jason was the second to be murdered
    But he was murdered on the 11th of June
    He is 20yrs old, black curly hair, tall and also in grade 11
    He was murdered in his home with a bullet pierced through his forehead
    His parents were away when the incident had happened
    They found him dead in the sitting room when they arrived
    <P>
    John Justin was the last to be murdered
    He is the same age as Eric.. Same grade and also the same day both were murdered
    John was a tall black skinned guy
    He was murdered in the school toilet with his Head brutally bashed with an object we have no idea of
    
    That's all of it Mr Barry... Benjamin said as he hands over the case file to me
    
    "Mr Benjamin was the Head of the police investigation department"
    
    The case was filed two days ago by both the school and parents of the deceased
    
    I want you look into it for me... You're the best detective I know
    I believe you'll find out who was behind all 3 murders
    Don't let me down
    
    I won't sir... Be rest assured that the murderer will be put behind bars
    I said while leaving
    
    I drove back home.. 
    It was late.. I felt hungry
    So I prepared coffee for the night
    After that I went to sleep in order to wake up early to Begin my investigation
    
    **********</P>
    
    It was 7am in the morning...
    I quickly dressed up and head for the school to see the principal
    I locked my doors, hop into my car and drove directly to the school
    
    I arrived at the school... I saw a man at the entrance.. He was tall and dark skinned
    I moved closer to him and then ask him if perhaps he knows the principal's office
    
    Hi... My name is Barry Oliver
    I'm here to see the principal for something important
    
    Oh... Really?
    How important is it? He said with a smirk on his face
    
    Its very important... I need to see him
    
    OK..very well then
    Follow me.. He said leading me to the principal's office
    
    Here we are.. 
    You can go in... I have some other work to do.. Good luck
    He said while leaving
    
    I knocked on the door as I entered into his office
    
    Good morning Sir... I'm Barry Oliver.. A detective
    I'm here for some questioning concerning the murder of the 3 students in this school..
    
    I'll like to get some answers from you Sir
    <P>
    Oh!... You are welcome
    Please have a seat..
    I'll gladly give you the answers to your question
    
    OK Sir... I said
    
    Please call me Matthew...
    
    OK Mr Matthew... I'd like to ask when does the school open and when does it close? I asked
    
    Well... The school opens by 7am and closes by 3pm
    Those attending tutorials closes by 5pm.. He replied
    
    OK... Does the school have a boarding house or it's a day school?
    
    It's actually both day and boarding
    
    Interesting... 
    So by what time are students expected to be in their respected rooms?
    
    Well... 
    Once its 7pm.. Every students are in their respected rooms
    
    OK... Where were you when the murder took place on the 10th of June
    I want each and every details
    
    He said;
    "Well... I arrived school late that day feeling unwell so I had to go rest in the sick bay
    I didn't spy on teachers like I always used to.. You know, to be sure if they were busy teaching 
    I didn't go home that day either.. My body was completely weak
    So I slept in my office
    </P>
    When it was 11 emmm
    I can't really recall the time
    But I heard a loud scream
    I was curious.. I wanted to know who that was
    I stood up to  go check ... To my surprise I saw students gathered in the cafeteria
    I squeezed my way through
    I then saw a body on the floor..
    I was shocked... Samantha??
    
    Who could have done this..??
    Then I quickly called the police
    That's all Barry"
    
    Wow... 
    I was told it was the janitor that found her dead body in the cafeteria?
    
    "Yes..
    He was the one that raised the alarm" he replied 
    
    Nice... Can I see him? I asked
    
    Unfortunately you can not
    He comes here every 3days.. 
    
    Oh... I see
    If you don't mind I'll like to ask you another
    
    No problem Barry.. Go ahead
    He said with a smile on his face
    
    On the 11th of June.
    Both Eric and John were murdered
    Eric Was murdered in his home while John was murdered in the school toilet
    Can you please tell me what exactly you were doing and where were you?
    
    OK..
    "Emmm
    Concerning Eric, I know nothing about it
    His parent called me the next day stating he was shot.
    
    But John... John came to the school prom that night.. We had a short talk of how I wanted to enroll him in a competition coming up next week cause he was very brilliant
    
    After some time... One of our students came running to the Hall screaming. He asked us to follow him to the toilet
    He was literally shaking so we followed him
    
    To our surprise we saw John's head brutally bashed
    We were all shocked
    Then I called the police and sent everyone else to their respected rooms
    
    That's all I know Mr Barry"
    
    Do strangers come into the school unannounced? I asked
    
    No Sir... We have a rule here
    "No strangers are allowed into the school"
    
    I guess you guys have cameras implanted in the whole school?
    
    About that .... Emmm
    The cameras were faulty.. We called someone to fix it for us
    Unfortunately... The cameras were burnt so they needed to be replaced
    So it took two days for it to get done
    So there were no recordings or whatsoever
    <P>
    Wow... This could have led Us directly to the murderers
    OK.. Can I look around the cafeteria and the toilet?
    
    Sure Mr Barry.. Come along let me take you there
    He said as he stood up heading to the cafeteria
    
    Here it is Mr Barry... I'll be right here waiting for you...
    He said standing at the entrance
    
    I'll take a look around if I could find anything.. I replied as I walked around the cafeteria
    
    I searched around looking for a clue but didn't find any
    I gave up searching...
    I was on my way out when I sighted a ring stained with blood towards the entrance..
    
    I took out my handkerchief and picked it up
    I kept it in my bags of clues
    
    I called Mr Matthew and showed him what I found
    I asked him if he could recognise it
    
    Mr Matthew.. Does this look familiar to you? I asked 
    
    I've never seen this before... This is just the first time seeing it.. He replied looking confused
    
    Wow.. No worries then..
    I'll like to see the toilet too
    
    Alright.. Please follow me.. He said leading me to the toilet
    
    Here it is... We didn't clean the whole place in order not to clear off some clues
    You could take a look around
    
    I walked in.. Searched every nook and cranny of the toilet
    But I found something interesting
    There was the same ring I found in the cafeteria closer to where John was brutally murdered
    But this time it was a lady's
    
    This is starting to get confusing.. I said to myself
    
    I didn't bother showing it to the principal... He wouldn't know who owns it..
    So I decided not to tell him anything
    
    Excuse me sir... I couldn't find anything here..
    Its just empty.. 
    
    Oh. Really?
    That's not good
    I believe we could tidy up the place now? He asked
    
    No... Not now
    There may be clues hidden in there somewhere
    
    But for now... Do not touch anything
    I said 
    
    I further asked if I could see all the students In grade 11
    
    Mr Matthew... Can I maybe see all the students in grade 11?
    Just for some mild questioning.. Nothing much
    
    No worries Barry.... Come with me.. He said leading me to their Classroom...
    
    We finally got there... 
    
    They weren't that much.... This wouldn't take time.. I said while I entered
    
    I Hope you get the answers you are looking for...
    I'll be in my office... He said while leaving the classroom
    
    Good day.... Emmm
    My name is Barry Oliver and I'm a detective
    I came here to get some answers to my question which you guys could help me with
    Is that a yes?
    
    They all chorused "Yes"
    
    Good one
    So was Samantha into any fight with someone before her death?
    
    No sir... She doesn't make troubles
    She is a very calm person
    
    Really?  And how do you know this? 
    What's your name?
    I asked
    
    She is my best friend Sir.... 
    My name is Ursula ..
    
    Alright Ursula...
    Can you tell me exactly what happened that night and where were you?
    
    She said;
    " after school hours, we were in our respective rooms
    Minutes later... She said she wanted to visit the cafeteria that she was feeling kinda hungry
    I didn't question her...
    After some hours... She didn't come Back
    I started to get worried... I rushed down to the cafeteria to find out why she wasn't back yet.
    Only for me to see other students gathered around
    I asked one one of them what's wrong
    She didn't reply so I had to just squeeze my way forward
    I was shocked when I saw Samantha in a pool of her own blood..
    How could this happen... I asked myself
    So we all went back to our respective rooms
    I was unable to sleep that night
    </P>
    That's all I know sir"
    
    Wow.....
    Since you both are best friends
    What do you both do on daily basis?
    
    Well... Nothing much
    We come to school, then attend tutorials after closing hours
    Then we go to our respective rooms
    
    But sometimes we stay late in school to read .
    That's our normal routine
    
    Hmmm.. Ok
    Does Samantha maybe have a boyfriend or crush?
    
    Well I wouldn't say a boyfriend..
    But she and John were very close
    That's all I know
    
    They are dating... Stop lying to him. They all shouted
    
    OK class.. Calm down
    There is no need for all these
    
    John??
    There is still more to this... I said to myself
    
    Then I saw a boy looking so uncomfortable and distressed
    Hey kid!!! I screamed
    
    Come over here
    He hesitated for a little while but he later obliged
    
    What's wrong kid... Anything the matter? I asked
    
    He is just scared.. A boy shouted
    Then the whole class burst into laughter
    
    That's enough.. I said looking serious
    So what's your name boy? I asked
    
    My name is Jerry..
    
    OK Jerry.. Why do you look so stressed?
    Any problem?
    
    No... Problem Sir.. He replied
    
    Are you sure? You look kinda stressed out
    Is there something you wish to tell me or everyone?
    
    No Sir... I'm fine!!!
    He said going back to his seat
    
    I wasn't satisfied
    There is something suspicious about this kid... I said while I checked my time
    
    I rounded up the conversation telling them I'll be back tomorrow
    
    I went to the principal's office... 
    I told him I'll be back tomorrow
    I'm off to see Samantha's parents
    
    Alright Barry.
    I'd be expecting you
    He said 
    
    I went out of his office going towards my car
    
    I kept thinking on the way
    
    The two rings
    How come?
    Both a lady and a guy ring
    
    Then I thought about that kid
    
    What is he hiding from me.. He looks suspicious
    Does he have something to do with the murder or does he knows something which could lead us to the murderer?
    
    .
    Well that's a question I can't answer
    The next episode will Tell..
