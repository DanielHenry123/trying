 I found it... I finally found it..
Daphne yelled white pointing at the monitor
This could bring about a change in the Medical history..
It would change the future...
I can't wait to tell Henry.. She said while walking out of her office

"Daphne Richards, a lab scientists working in the john Hopkins medical hospital"

Hey Henry! Henry!! 
Come with me... I have to show you something

Where to Daphne? Henry asked while concentrating on his work..
Can't you see I'm kinda busy right now

"Henry George, Daphne's assistant.. Also works in the John Hopkins medical hospital"

Just follow me to my office Henry... I promise it won't take long.. You'll be amazed.
Daphne said dragging Henry to her office

There it is Henry... Daphne said pointing to the monitor
I finally found it..

The "Kalahoka tree"
This tree is located deep inside the Amazon forest..
It produces this specific flowers which is capable of curing any type of disease.
It also blooms every 30yrs on the night of a full Moon... If my calculations are correct... It's going to bloom 15 days from now
Just imagine Henry.. This could change our lives

Wow Daphne.. I'm really impressed
This could really change our lives and the lives of millions of people
You've really outdone yourself this time Daphne
So what do we do now?  Henry asked

We are going to get the flower of course..

Whoa... Hold it
We are talking about the Amazon here... It's too dangerous.
There are blood thirsty animals in that forest.. We could die Daphne
Here is an idea.. Why don't we hire someone to get it for us?

Really Henry.. And you think the person won't try to run away or sell it to an organization or an hospital?
Come on Henry.... We can't let this get into the wrong hands

Please Henry... I can't let this pass me by ..
It took me years of hard work and research..

We ain't gonna die Henry... We would be careful.
This is our only chance... If we don't get this now.. We'd have to wait for another 30yrs
Think Henry... This could be our only chance

Alright Daphne.. Just because it means so much to you..
We would go

Thank you so much Henry... You're the best
But this should be between you and I
No one else needs to hear this... We need to be careful

OK Daphne.. But there is a problem
What are we going to tell the hospital administrators about our absence..
Won't they find out? Henry asked

Do not bother yourself Henry... I've got an idea..
Just give me few minutes.. I'll be back.. Daphne said as she walks out of her office

Hey watch it... I could have fallen you know... Daphne yelled
Oh... It's you harry

"Harry Osborne, also a lab scientists and Daphne's rival"

Oh.. I'm sorry Daphne
Maybe if you take off those glasses you'd see better.. Harry laughed

I've got some important things to do.. Just get out of my way.. Daphne said as she walks passed Harry

This is strange.. Where would she be heading to in such a hurry
I must find out..

Mr Bruce! Mr Bruce!! .. Wait up
Daphne yelled

"Bruce Holland.. One of the headAdministrators in the John Hopkins medical hospital"

What is it this time Daphne.. I don't have time for your nonsense today.. I have a meeting to attend

Oh no.. I've come here to ask for a favour Sir.. 

What is it? Bruce asked

My Grandma is severely sick and she needs to be taken care of
She is suffering from cancer.. She only has 16 days to live.. I need to be by her side Mr Bruce

What about the unfinished project? Who will handle that

It's no problem Sir... I'll take Henry along with me..
The projects will surely be completed

OK Daphne... You and Henry could go... But it shouldn't be more than 17 days
If you aren't back by then... Both you and Henry are fired!!

Thank you Mr Bruce... Daphne said while running back to her office

We're free to go Henry.. I've Just spoken to Mr Bruce
I just lied to him about my Grandma being sick
He gave us 17 days

That's great... I just hope we ain't gonna get caught.
So when are we going? Henry asked

Tomorrow of course .. Get ready.. Cause its gonna be a loonngg trip
We'd travel by air.. It would be faster that way

Whatever you say Daphne.. I just hope we make it out alive

We will Henry.
I need to go call someone now..
I'd meet you at the airport tomorrow

Why would Daphne lie to Bruce and where are they heading to... What are they up to?
Harry asked as he sneaked into Daphne's office

"Kalahoka tree".. Hmm
Interesting

What are you doing here Harry? Daphne asked standing at the entrance

Emm. I was emm
I came here to apologize For what happened earlier.. I'm so sorry Daphne

Its fine Harry.. You can leave now

Thank you Daphne... Harry said as he left the office

Gosh!!.. I didn't turn off the computer.. I hope he didn't see anything.. I have to be careful around him
Daphne said as she turned off the computer and locked the door of her official

**********
They both arrived in Brazil the next day

Isn't it beautiful Henry.. Daphne said as she spreads both hands

Of course.. It is beautiful

Mrs Daphne.. Welcome.. I've been expecting you
Let me help you with your bags.. Mr Antonio said

"Mr Antonio... Daphne's friend and a taxi driver in Brazil"

Thank you Mr Antonio.. I'm glad you came

Immediately you called telling me you're visiting Brazil... I rushed as soon as I can
Hi sir... I'm Antonio..
You are? Antonio asked Henry

Hi I'm Henry.. Daphne's friend

You're welcome.. Please follow me... Antonio said leading them to his car.

So Mr Antonio.. Do you anyone who could take us into the Amazon? Daphne asked

Eerrh.. Yes I do know someone
He lives in the Manaus city here in Brazil
He is a sailor too... He'll take you wherever you want
Do you want me to take you there now? Antonio asked while driving

Sure.. I'd like to see him..

OK Mrs Daphne.. But if I may ask.. Why the Amazon?

It's no worries Mr Antonio.. It's just for work.

OK.. If you say so.. Antonio said as he drove them to Manaus city

We are here... 
There he is ... We came at the right time
Give me few minutes let me

go call him

Hey Pedro..

(How are you doing man?)

"Pedro.. A sailor and a fisherman in Manaus city"

(Antonio.. Its been a while.. How are you doing?)

Estou ótimo pedro .. Trouxe algumas pessoas para te ver .. Venha comigo
(I'm doing great Pedro.. I brought some people to see you.. Come with me)

Quem são eles? pedro perguntou espero que seja algo tangível
(Who are they? Pedro asked
I hope its something tangible)

Mrs Daphne.. Here he is
Antonio said pointing at Pedro

Hi I'm Daphne Richards
I need you to take me to the Amazon
Can I see you alone please?

OK ma'am.. Pedro said following Daphne

Mr Pedro..
I need you to take me into the Amazon to go get the flower from the kalahoka tree

Are you crazy ma'am? 
No  one has ever survived.. Its too dangerous
I can't

Come on.. 
I'll pay 100 thousand dollars

No can't do ma'am... I can't risk it

How about 200 thousand dollars?

Still not going.. Pedro said 

OK.. 500 thousand dollars.
I really need this flower

Hmm.. OK then
We can go

But I must warn you.. If you die, I'd not take responsibility for it
No one has ever come back...
Do you have a deal?

Well.. No problem then
Shall we? Daphne said

Let's go
My boat is over there.. Come along

Is he coming with us? Pedro asked pointing at Henry

Sure.. He is
Come along Henry.. We have to go

Right now? Henry asked

Sure.. Come on
Goodbye Mr Antonio.. Thank you for everything
Daphne yelled waving at Mr Antonio

You're welcome Daphne... I hope you find what you're looking for.. Antonio yelled back as he walks towards his car

They set sail going to the Amazon forest
Will Daphne and Henry both get the flower?

Will they make it out alive?
